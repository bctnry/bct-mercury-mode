### Notes
1. I have learned a lot from [Xah Lee's wonderful turtorial](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_write_major_mode_index.html)
   on how to write major modes for langs when making this thing. Strongly recommend it.

2. There's still a lot of refinements to do, but I've been kept busy for a long time & I might be also very busy
   in the foreseeable future, so... yeah. Maybe they'll never be done. Who knows.

3. And key bindings might also change in the future.
